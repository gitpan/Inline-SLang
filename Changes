# Revision history for Inline::SLang

--
version: 0.03
date:    Tue Jan 28 12:01:49 EST 2003
changes:
 - Initial CPAN release (for feedback/comments as still pre-alpha)
 - S-Lang's associative arrays are supported (in so far as there is
   1D array support for the data type of the stored data)
 - S-Lang's Complex_Type is stored as a Math::Complex object in Perl
   and can convert between the two languages (scalars only)
 - S-Lang's Datatype_Type is represented as an Inline::SLang::datatype
   object (scalars only).
 - 1/2D array support (S-Lang to Perl) no longer lumps together similar
   datatypes (eg char, short, int, long) into the code (should we just
   typecast them to long in S-Lang scope instead?)
 - Complex types are supported in 1 & 2D arrays
 - documentation split: data type information is now in a separate pod,
   Inline::SLang::Types.
 - 'perl Makefile.PL' now supports the --gdb(=string) flag (--help for 
   help)
   Initial support for both static and dynamically-loaded forms of the 
   S-Lang library.
   Added Test::More as a requirement.
