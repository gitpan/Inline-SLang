# Revision history for Inline::SLang

--
version: 0.04
date:    Fri Mar  7 00:14:47 EST 2003
changes:
 - The copyright holder is now the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.
 - The license changed to GNU General Public License only (prior to v0.04
   it was distributed under a dual "perl or GNU GPL license" scheme)

 - S-Lang's Struct_Type variables are converted to Inline::SLang::struct
   objects, assuming the types of the fields are also supported.
   The conversion leaks memory.
 - 1D and 2D support for DataType variables (S-Lang to Perl)
 - Fixed mem leaks in the code converting associative-array
 - improvement to access 1D/2D arrays of Complex_Type values; users
   should see no change because of this
 - internal function added to access S-Lang version module was compiled
   against. This is almost-certainly not needed.
 - Conversion of perl types to S-Lang is still very limited.

 - added the configuration option BIND_NS: only functions in namespaces
   in this list are bound to Perl. Note that S-Lang intrinsic functions
   are not bound to Perl and that S-Lang functions in namespace foo
   (ie that would be evaluated via foo->function_name() in S-Lang)
   are accessed via foo::function_name() in Perl. See the TODO file for
   possible future upgrades.
 - improved the build/load functions used when evaluating/loading the
   S-Lang code. This stops the S-Lang code being evaluated twice the
   first time a file was evaluated.

 - further separation (and improvement) of test cases

version: 0.03
date:    Tue Jan 28 12:01:49 EST 2003
changes:
 - Initial CPAN release (for feedback/comments as still pre-alpha)
 - S-Lang's associative arrays are supported (in so far as there is
   1D array support for the data type of the stored data)
 - S-Lang's Complex_Type is stored as a Math::Complex object in Perl
   and can convert between the two languages (scalars only)
 - S-Lang's Datatype_Type is represented as an Inline::SLang::datatype
   object (scalars only).
 - 1/2D array support (S-Lang to Perl) no longer lumps together similar
   datatypes (eg char, short, int, long) into the code (should we just
   typecast them to long in S-Lang scope instead?)
 - Complex types are supported in 1 & 2D arrays
 - documentation split: data type information is now in a separate pod,
   Inline::SLang::Types.
 - 'perl Makefile.PL' now supports the --gdb(=string) flag (--help for 
   help)
   Initial support for both static and dynamically-loaded forms of the 
   S-Lang library.
   Added Test::More as a requirement.
