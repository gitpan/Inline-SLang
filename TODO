Tests
-----

Need to test the integer types more fully.

S-Lang to Perl
--------------

 Functions:
  - handle reference types; are there others that are needed?

  - improve the support of 2D arrays
  - add support for nD arrays

  - do we bind intrinsic functions?
  - do we bind functions in other namespaces, and if so how do we
    call these functions from perl?

 Variables:
  - do we want to allow access to S-Lang variables?

Perl to S-Lang
--------------

 - most of it needs to be done!

General
-------

 - decide how to handle errors.

 - how do we support PDL? Should there be an option to convert
   arrays using one of:
     plain perl, return as a single 'string', as a piddle

 - improve documentation

Configuration
-------------

 - S-Lang has support for byte-compiled code. The module could
   save the byte-compiled code instead of (or as well as) the
   text version of the code. It may provide a slight performance
   gain when loading?
